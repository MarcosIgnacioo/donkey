is greater thant the w

this can encode all kind of rules

as u can ssee jhere we 


left is a how can i get this label what will rplus parsing

we wonan 

as u can see w r recursin 

this infix operators are always gonna be parsing what comes on the right by invoking th parsin again, interestingly it invokes the parser with a precedence of 2

this is to indicate how far this invokations can go 

just parse what is strong enough to be parsed, aka, if the tokens have greater precedence welll they r gonna be infix parsed babyyy


a + b * c

here what prat t parsin does is to associate b with c because * has higher precedence

nd again it invokes the parser with 2 the same as this as i say it will become clear why iss this dthe case theis plus is lef tassociate  to that right asocaite
